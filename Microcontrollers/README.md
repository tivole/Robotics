# Microcontrollers â€“ Types & Applications


## What is a Microcontroller?

A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies, which usually include:

- An 8 or 16 bit microprocessor.
- A little measure of RAM.
- Programmable ROM and flash memory.
- Parallel and serial I/O.
- Timers and signal generators.
- Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog conversion

Microcontrollers usually must have low-power requirements since many devices they control are battery-operated. Microcontrollers are used in many consumer electronics, car engines, computer peripherals and test or measurement equipment. And these are well suited for long lasting battery applications. The dominant part of microcontrollers being used now a days are implanted in other apparatus.


## How are Microcontrollers Classified?

The microcontrollers are characterized regarding bus-width, instruction set, and memory structure. For the same family, there may be different forms with different sources. This article is going to describe some of the basic types of the Microcontroller that newer users may not know about.
