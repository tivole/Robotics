## Description
**MAG3110** is a small, low-power, digital 3-axis magnetometer. The device can be used in conjunction with a 3-axis accelerometer to produce orientation independent accurate compass heading information. It features a standard I2C serial interface output and smart embedded functions. It's also a tiny QFN package which isn't very easy to play with so here is our easy to use breakout board. This board breaks out all of the pins for the MAG3110 to a standard 0.1" header and also supplies the necessary filtering capacitors so that you can easily use it in your next navigation project.
